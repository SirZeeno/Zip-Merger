# Zip Merger
A Work in progress multi-platform (as the name implies) Zip Merger. It has a simple UI to make use of it as simple as possible. The basic premise of the Program is to merge Zip files in case you create zip files of folders or files to back them up with a bit of compression and you seem to accumulate a lot of the same Zip files and need a way to merge and de-duplicate them.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a passion project like most of my projects, meaning I work on this Project in my free time and will update and expand as much and soon as I can, please be patient with me :).
